Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: March Madness Bracket Prediction](https://github.com/luke-as-11/march_madness_bracket_prediction)
- Designed an adaptive function utilizing machine learning to progressively predict the 2025 March Madness Bracket round by round
- Collected ten years of team statistics from ESPN's historical data records
- Structured yearly data to simulate a 63 match tournament with each entry representing a match 
- Visualized the impact of the difference between team statistics on match outcomes
- Trained a neural network model to predict win probability
- Gained obtainable results to verify model's performance where 73% of game outcomes were predicted correctly
- Learned about the bias in the data and how to fine-tune neural network models
